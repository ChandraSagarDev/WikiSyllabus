# ae304c: aerodynamics-ii
  - (AE304C: Aerodynamics II)

## Course Objectives
* To provide a deeper understanding of compressible flow phenomena relevant to high-speed aerodynamics.  
* To study shock waves, expansion waves, and shock–boundary layer interactions.  
* To introduce fundamental principles of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics.  
* To apply compressible flow theory to high-speed airfoils, nozzles, and wind tunnel testing.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Review of Compressible Flow Concepts
* Isentropic flow relations and area–Mach number variations.  
* Normal and oblique shocks – fundamental properties.  
* Prandtl–Meyer expansions.  
* Stagnation properties and compressibility effects.  
* Application in nozzles and diffusers.  

### Module 2: Supersonic Flow Over Airfoils
* Thin supersonic airfoil theory.  
* Lift and drag calculations.  
* Shock-expansion theory.  
* Supersonic flow over wedges and cones.  
* Applications in high-speed aircraft wings.  

### Module 3: Shock–Boundary Layer Interaction
* Structure of the boundary layer in high-speed flows.  
* Separation and reattachment.  
* Oblique shock interaction with boundary layers.  
* Control of shock-induced separation.  
* Applications in inlets and control surfaces.  

### Module 4: High-Speed Wind Tunnel Techniques
* Types of high-speed wind tunnels.  
* Test section design and operation principles.  
* Instrumentation for compressible flows – Pitot tubes, Schlieren, shadowgraph.  
* Measurement of Mach number, pressure, and shock properties.  
* Data analysis in supersonic/hypersonic tunnels.  

### Module 5: Introduction to Hypersonic Aerodynamics
