# ae307c: aerospace-structures-iii
  - (AE307C: Aerospace Structures III)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce advanced concepts in structural analysis of aerospace vehicles.  
* To study the behavior of plates, shells, and thin-walled structures under aerodynamic loads.  
* To understand the fundamentals of aeroelasticity and structural stability.  
* To apply structural theories to aircraft wings, fuselage, and control surfaces.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Bending of Thin Plates
* Kirchhoff plate theory.  
* Plate bending under distributed loads.  
* Navier’s and Levy’s solutions (introduction).  
* Applications in wing skins and fuselage panels.  
* Stress resultants and boundary conditions.  

### Module 2: Buckling of Plates and Panels
* Buckling of plates under uni-axial and bi-axial loads.  
* Local buckling of stiffened panels.  
* Effective width concepts.  
* Post-buckling behavior (qualitative).  
* Applications in aircraft wing and fuselage structures.  

### Module 3: Shell Structures
* Introduction to cylindrical and conical shells.  
* Stress resultants in thin shells.  
* Stability and buckling of shells.  
* Applications in rocket bodies and fuselage structures.  
* Simplified analysis approaches.  

### Module 4: Introduction to Aeroelasticity
* Aeroelastic phenomena – divergence, control reversal, flutter.  
* Static aeroelasticity – divergence speed, aileron reversal.  
* Dynamic aeroelasticity – flutter mechanisms and stability boundaries.  
* Coupled aerodynamic–structural modeling (overview).  
* Aeroelastic design considerations.  

### Module 5: Structural Dynamics (Introduction)
* Free and forced vibration of beams and plates.  
* Modal analysis and natural frequencies.  
* Response to harmonic loads.  
* Damping mechanisms.  
* Applications in landing gears, wings, and rotorcraft.
