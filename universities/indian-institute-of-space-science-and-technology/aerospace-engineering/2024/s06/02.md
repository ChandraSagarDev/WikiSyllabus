  - (AE305C: Flight Mechanics II)

## Course Objectives
* To provide an in-depth understanding of aircraft dynamic stability and control.  
* To derive and analyze the linearized equations of aircraft motion.  
* To study longitudinal and lateral–directional dynamic modes.  
* To apply flight dynamic models for stability analysis, simulation, and control design.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Aircraft Equations of Motion
