## Course Objectives
* To extend the principles of gas turbine and rocket propulsion to advanced configurations.  
* To study performance characteristics of compressors, turbines, combustors, and nozzles.  
* To analyze the design and working of air-breathing high-speed engines such as ramjets and scramjets.  
* To understand advanced concepts in liquid and solid rocket propulsion.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Advanced Gas Turbine Cycle Analysis
* Review of Brayton cycle and real-cycle effects.  
* Regeneration, inter-cooling, and reheating.  
* Component efficiencies and their influence on cycle performance.  
* Turbojet and turbofan cycle performance parameters.  
* Afterburning and thrust augmentation techniques.  

### Module 2: Compressors and Turbines
* Axial and centrifugal compressors – design principles.
