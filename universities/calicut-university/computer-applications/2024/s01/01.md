# BCA1CJ103: Discrete Structures for Computer Applications

## Course Objectives
* Provide a foundational understanding of essential concepts fundamental to computer science and mathematics.
* Explore topics related to Propositional Logic, Sets and Relations, Graphs, and Trees.
* Equip students with the analytical and problem-solving skills necessary for applications in computer science and algorithm design.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Acquire a comprehensive understanding of propositional logic and its applications, with a focus on constructing and interpreting truth tables.
* **CO 2:** Proficiently define and manipulate sets, analyse relations and functions and their representation by Venn diagrams.
* **CO 3:** Acquire a basic understanding of graph theory including representations, types of graphs, their properties such as connectivity, cycles, paths and degrees.
* **CO 4:**  Demonstrate a deep understanding of advanced graph theory concepts, focusing on Euler's graph, Hamiltonian graphs, Isomorphism and Homeomorphism.
* **CO 5:** Proficiently understand the tree data structures, spanning trees and associated algorithms for solving problems such as Prim's and Kruskal.
* **CO 6:**  Represent various mathematical problems using algorithmic approaches and enhance problem-solving skills by visualizing solutions through the utilization of software tools.
